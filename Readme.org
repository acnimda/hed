* Host file Editor (hed)

**NOTE**: in no way is this tool ready for production use!

~hed~ is a tool to easily update en inspect the ~/etc/hosts~ file.

** Add new entries

#+begin_src shell
hed add something.local.dev 127.0.0.1
#+end_src

** TODO Remove entries

#+begin_src shell
hed delete something.local.dev
#+end_src

Note: ~localhost~ is a "safe" host and can not be deleted.

** Inspect the hosts file

#+begin_src shell
hed show
#+end_src

~show~ will parse and print the ~hosts~ file
